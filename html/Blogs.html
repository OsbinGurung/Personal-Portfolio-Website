src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/main_title.jpg" width="500px"
height="250px;" style="padding: 20px;"> <p>Internet technology has changed how
we live our lives now compared to the lifestyles of 20 years ago. We now are
dependent upon internet technologies where most works are done with the help
of internet technology. Internet technology has improved alot over the last
decade and now Internet technologies like smartphones, laptops, computers,
tablets,etc are available. Internet technology are now easy to get and is
available to the general public. Internet technology is small and compact
which makes it easier to travel with where you can fit a smartphone with
capabilities of a computer inside your pockets. These changes has brought
positives and negatives impact on our daily lives and society. Some of the
changes brought by internet technology are written below.</p> </div> </div>

<h1>Internet technology has changed how we communicate</h1><br> <img

height="150px;" style="padding: 20px;"> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/phone-call.jpeg" width="200px"
height="150px;" style="padding: 20px;"> <p>Internet technologies has changed
our ways of communication alot. Internet technology like Email, smartphones,
video chat, messaging apps, etc are some of the most used forms of internet
communication used today. Since internet has been easily available to
everyone, communication through the internet is possible. Messaging apps like
Viber, Messenger, Whatsapp, Telegram has made communication much more easier
as people can text each other through the internet via the messaging app.
Mails are used for delivering large objects or items only and the use of mails
for sending messages to others has been decreasing so much that people doesnot
use mails to send messages alot. With the help of internet technology, a
person is able to communicatio with another person living very far away with
just a stable internet connection.Through the internet you can video call a
person, send a text, email a person, watch online videos, conduct online
classes, etc. This all is possible with the internet as it is more cost
efficient that other means of communication. So in a sense, internet
technology has redefined how we communication with eadch other. </p> </div>
</div> <div class="blogs"> <div id="blog3"> <h1>Technology has changed how we
pay bills and transfer money</h1><br> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/Send-Money-Online.png"
width="200px" height="150px;"  style="padding: 20px;"> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/pay_bills.png" width="200px"
height="150px;" style="padding: 20px;"> <p>Another aspect of our life that
internet technology has changed is how we pay bills and transfer money. Before
we used to pay our bills by going directly to the office and pay it and go to
the bank to transfer money to someone else but now we can do it over the
internet and has some benefits from it too. Using technologies like a
smartphone, laptop or computer we can pay our bills and transfer money from
our home with the help of an internet. This benefits us alot as we do not have
to wait in line to pay our water bills or electricity bills as these could be
paid online with the help of the internet from our home. The same also goes
for transferring money as we can just do it online. Not only do we not have to
stay in a line but we can also get confirmation that we have paid our bills or
the other person has received the money we had just transferred and this is
can be known after paying our bills or after sending money. </p> </div> </div>
<div class="blogs"> <div id="blog4"> <h1>Technology has changed how we watch
tv</h1><br> <img src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/youtube.jpg"
width="200px" height="150px;" style="padding: 20px;"> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/netflix.jpg" width="200px"
height="150px;" style="padding: 20px;"> <p>The way we watch tv has also
changed compared to how it was before. Before we used to watch television
through a dedicated cable to watch but now with the internet we most probably
do not require such cables dedicated for television only. Now with the
advancement of the television, tv's now can connect to the internet and could
be used to surf the internet too. With such feature, watching videos from
Youtube is possible and even Netflix with the internet. Nowadays even tv
remote even come with a Youtube and Netflix button. The way we used to watch
tv has changed drastically to the point that some people only watch TV's for
Youtube and Netflix only. </p> </div> </div> <div class="blogs"> <div
id="blog5"> <h1>Technology has changed how we stay save</h1><br> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/security_camera.jpg" width="200px"
height="150px;"  style="padding: 20px;"> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/motion_sensor.jpg" width="200px"
height="150px;"  style="padding: 20px;"> <p>Before we used to keep security
guards and dogs in our house to portect ourselves from intruders in our home.
But with the advancement of Internet technology has made it possible to stay
save inside and outside our homes. We have security camera, motion sensor
cameras, gps in our phones, alarms to alert us and many more ways to keep
ourself save. Even if we are outside, our phones and smart watches has a
emergency function if we are  in any danger, they could contact people in our
emergency contact alerting them our location and even condtion. Some smart
watches has feature that monitors our heartbeat and if our heatbeat is below
the normal range and is decreasing then the smart watch alerts any emergency
contact of ours. Internet technology has helped us to stay save anywhere we
are. </p> </div> </div> <div class="blogs_title"> <div id="negative_impact">
<p><u>Negative Impact</u></p> </div> </div> <div class="blogs"> <div
id="blog6"> <h1>Technology has affected our sleeping habits</h1><br> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/watchingphone_late_night.jpg"
width="400px" height="250px;"  style="padding: 20px;"> <p>Many of us tend to
stay up late at night texting friends or scrolling through social media. Since
there are many entertainment contente online we tend to watch them once we get
hooked to it. Many people tend to stay up late at night to watch a movie or
series or even to play games online with their friends. Such habits has
affected our sleeping habits. Lack of sleep or bad sleepipng habits can cause
irritability, impulsive behaviour, anxiety, depression, weakens immunity
system which harms both our physical and mental health. Technology has caused
such problems to be seen in our society.</p> </div> </div> <div class="blogs">
<div id="blog7"> <h1>Cyber bullying and Cyber crimes has increased</h1><br>
<img src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/cyberbullying.jpg"
width="300px" height="200px;"  style="padding: 20px;"> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/cyber_crimes.webp" width="300px"
height="200px;"  style="padding: 20px;"> <p>The rise in Cyber bullying and
Cyber crimes has increased in number since the increase in used of internet
technology. Cyber bullying has increased alot as it is a form of bullying
others online without having your identity known. This has caused an increase
in suicide by mostly teenagers as a result of cyber bullying. Cyber crimes has
also risen in number too. Cyber crimes like scams, fishing, hacking, identity
theft, stealing personal or important information, online fraud and many more
has increased. Due to this many people are a victim to this unkowningly. Most
people lose personal infromation, money and even devices are attacked making
them inoperatable. Internet technology has given a new form of bullying and
crimes. </p> </div> </div> <div class="blogs"> <div id="blog8"> <h1>Explicit
content are more easily available to the children</h1><br> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/explicit_content.png"
width="300px" height="200px;"  style="padding: 20px;"> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/violent_content.jpg" width="300px"
height="200px;"  style="padding: 20px;"> <p>Many parents are concerned for
their children as explicit contents and violence are easily accessible on the
internet. Even when using parental controls on the devices that a children
use, they are exposed to explicit and violent content in one point or the
other. This can cause the childrens thinking capabilities to become more
negative and cause change in behaviour causing aggression and lack of empathy.
Such things happen as they are exposed to the explicit and violent content
online making them lack of enpathy towards others.</p> </div> </div> <div
class="blogs"> <div id="blog9"> <h1>Children's are addicted to playing online
games</h1><br> <img
src="D:\20049190_Osbin_Gurung\img\blogs_img/Video_Game_Addiction.jpg"
width="400px" height="250px;"  style="padding: 20px;"> <p>Online games are
easily accessible and many children get addicted to them. Mostly due to their
friends influence a child starts playing games but if the child starts to get
addicted towards them it will cause some problems for the child. The child
would not fully develop social skills, get aggressive towards others and will
only want to play games instead of doing their works. This has caused alot of
changes in a child personality in which they become addicted to the internet
and does not do any work or go outside to play. The children gets less
exercise and does not have good social skills. Internet has caused childrens
to be addicted to games and their devices.</p> </div> </div> <div
class="blogs"> <div id="blog10"> <h1>Overall Verdict</h1><br> <p>In
conclusion, internet and it's technology has brought alot of changes in our
daily lives. Some good and some bad but overall we can say that internet
technology has brought alot of positive changes around and has in some ways
helped us in our lives. The positive effect of internet technologies outweighs
the negative impacts but the negative impacts are still available. Some rules
or restriction can be used to minimise the negative impacts of internet on our
daily lives. We can only minimise the negative effects of internet technology
by being aware, limiting the use of internet and to use the internet safely
and securely.  </p> </div> </div> </div>	 </div>
